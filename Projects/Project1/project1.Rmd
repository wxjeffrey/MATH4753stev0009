abstract: This project is all about analysing the SWDEFECTS file using R and probability theory. You will need to change the headings to reflect the nature of the project intentions. Re write this abstract as the last thing you do.

# Introduction to the data

## Data and variables(see MS pg. 77,125)
 
This data file contains 498 modules of software code written in C for NASA spacecraft instruments. For each of these modules, the code was evaluated line-by-line to check for defects. If a defect exists, it is labeled with "true", otherwise it is labeled with "false". Various other methods were also used to predict if a module has a defect or not (lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, essential complexity, and design complexity). Each method has a corresponding variable that is labeled with "yes" when a defect exists and "no" when there is no defect. We will be evaluating these different methods and using probabilities to understand how effective they are. 

## Summary Table 

Create the summary table (TABLE SIA3.2) found on page 125. You can use RMD code to do it -- see MARKDOWN QUICK REFERENCE in Rstudio help.

### Example RMD to make a table
```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```
First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

### Make formulae 

Using $\LaTeX$ construct the formulae for 

1. Accuracy
2. Detection rate
3. False alarm rate
4. Precision

Latex Example: See (http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#elements-of-math-mode)

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
P(|X-\mu| > k) & = & P(|X-\mu|^2 > k^2)\\
& \leq & \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[|X-\mu|^2\right]}{k^2}\\
& \leq & \frac{\mathrm{Var}[X]}{k^2}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

# R functions
Using the above definitions make R functions that will create the required probabilities, please remove `eval=FALSE` when creating the functions :

```{r accuracy, eval=FALSE}
acc=function(a,b,c,d)
{
  
}
```

```{r detecton, eval=FALSE}
detect=function(b,d)
{
  
}
```

```{r alarm, eval=FALSE}
falarm=function(a,c)
{
  
}
```

```{r precision, eval=FALSE}
prec=function(c,d)
{
  
}
```


# Create the tables in Figure SIA3.1

The tables do not have to be formatted exactly as those in the book. Have the functions produce a suitable barplot also. 
In other wordss you will use R code to make these tables (again formatting does not have to be the same as the book)

As a guide and help -- see code below

```{r }
swd=read.csv("swdefects.csv")
head(swd)
tab=with(swd, table(predict.loc.50,defect))
barplot(tab, beside=TRUE, leg=TRUE)
tab2=addmargins(tab)
tab2
```





# Create the corrected table on page 127 (there are mistakes in it), TABLE SIA3.3

Using the functions you have made **or otherwise**, create the corrected table (SIA3.3) in an R chunk -- that is, you will make an R function to create the table.
 
You can call this table `tab3`

Now create a function `mybar()`that will have as its input variables

>
    1. tab ( this will be a n by m table) - like `tab3`
    2. dec ( accuracy of the decimal output ) -- like `dec=4` for example would mean 4 decimal places (use `round()`)
    

    
The function will need to create two things

>
    1. A barplot of the table
    2. Commandline output in the form of a list containing the table
